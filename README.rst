dashQC: An interactive quality control dashboard
================================================

This dashboard is developed by the `SIMEXP lab <https://simexp.github.io/lab-website/>`_ at the `Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal <http://www.criugm.qc.ca/>`_. We use the dashboard daily in our lab internal quality control procedure to process large scale datasets.
