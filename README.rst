dashQC: An interactive quality control dashboard
================================================

This dashboard is developed by the `SIMEXP lab <https://simexp.github.io/lab-website/>`_ at the `Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal <http://www.criugm.qc.ca/>`_. We use the dashboard daily in our lab internal quality control procedure to process large scale datasets. A demo of the dashboard can be found `here <https://dashqc.github.io/>`_.

.. note:: ``dashQC_fmri`` is at an early stage of development and while we use
    it for our own quality control and are committed to developing it further, you may
    encounter problems. Please let us know about these by opening an `issue <https://github.com/SIMEXP/dashQC_fmri/issues>`_.
    Thanks a lot and have fun.

``dashQC`` is a modular, javascript based dashboard built to facilitate
the manual quality control process of functional MRI data. We currently provide
support for the outputs generated by
`fmriprep <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and
`NIAK <http://niak.simexp-lab.org/>`_. We have plans to extend this to a
prospective `BIDS derivative <http://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_ standard.

Roadmap
-------
We are currently focused on implementing feedback from users of ``dashQC_fmri`` to facilitate the QC workflow.
Our medium term goals are to create similar functionality for quality control with a focus on structural MRI.

short term goal
###############
- Separate QC rating for T1-template and EPI-T1 coregistraion (#29)
- Change the internal datastructure to allow for faster searching and richer linkage of subject level and run level information (#17)
- Changing QC rating layout

intermediate goal
#################
- Implement tagging
- fork project to create dashQC_structural

long term goal
##############
- Performance optimization
- Subject and run data linkage
