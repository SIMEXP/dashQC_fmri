dashQC: An interactive quality control dashboard
================================================

This dashboard is developed by the `SIMEXP lab <https://simexp.github.io/lab-website/>`_ at the `Centre de recherche de l'Institut universitaire de gériatrie de Montréal <http://www.criugm.qc.ca/>`_. We use the dashboard daily in our lab internal quality control procedure to process large scale datasets.

.. note:: ``dashQC_fmri`` is at an early stage of development and while we use
    it for our own quality control and are committed to developing it further, you may
    encounter problems. Please let us know about these by opening an `issue <https://github.com/SIMEXP/dashQC_fmri/issues>`_.
    Thanks a lot and have fun.

``dashQC`` is a modular, javascript based dashboard built to facilitate
the manual quality control process of functional MRI data. We currently provide
support for the outputs generated by
`fmriprep <https://fmriprep.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ and
`NIAK <http://niak.simexp-lab.org/>`_. We have plans to extend this to a
prospective `BIDS derivative <http://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_ standard.

If you encounter a bug or would like to contribute to this project, please open
an issue on our `github repository <https://github.com/SIMEXP/dashQC_fmri/issues>`_.
If you have questions about how to use ``dashQC_fmri`` please
head over to `neurostars.org <http://neurostars.org/>`_ and open a topic.
